## Introduction: The Evolution of Ingress in Kubernetes

Managing external access to applications running within a Kubernetes cluster is crucial. This "north-south" traffic, often referred to as ingress, has evolved significantly within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Initially, the `Service` API provided basic load balancing capabilities, but it lacked fine-grained control over routing. The `Ingress` API emerged as a solution specifically for HTTP routing, but its limitations in expressiveness and extensibility led to the development of the `Gateway` API.

### From Service to Ingress to Gateway: A Comparative Overview

## Core Concepts of the Gateway API

The Gateway API introduces several key resources that work together to manage ingress traffic:

*   **`GatewayClass`:** Defines a type of gateway implementation (e.g., "nginx", "contour", "istio"). It is managed by the Infrastructure Provider and represents the underlying controller responsible for handling traffic.
*   **`Gateway`:** An instance of a `GatewayClass`, deployed and managed by the Cluster Operator. It defines the entry point for external traffic, specifying listeners (ports and protocols).
*   **`HTTPRoute`:** Defines HTTP routing rules, managed by Application Developers. It specifies how traffic should be routed to backend services based on various matching criteria (hostnames, paths, headers, etc.).
*   **`TCPRoute`:** Defines TCP routing rules for Layer 4 traffic.
*   **`UDPRoute`:** Defines UDP routing rules for Layer 4 traffic.
*   **`TLSRoute`:** Defines routing rules for TLS-encrypted traffic at Layer 4, offering more control than TCPRoute.
*   **`ReferencePolicy`:** A mechanism to control which namespaces can reference resources in other namespaces.

---

### Role-Oriented Design

The Gateway API's role-oriented design is a significant improvement over the Ingress API. It promotes collaboration and security by clearly separating responsibilities:

*   **Infrastructure Provider:** Creates and manages `GatewayClasses`.
*   **Cluster Operator:** Deploys and manages `Gateways`, configuring listeners and overall network policies.
*   **Application Developer:** Defines `Routes` to expose their applications through existing `Gateways`.

### Example: Basic HTTP Routing

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: my-http-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway # Reference to the Gateway
  hostnames:
    - "example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /app
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: my-app-service
            port: 8080
```

This `HTTPRoute` directs traffic to `example.com/app` to the `my-app-service` on port 8080.

### Example: Header-Based Routing

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: header-routing
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - name: X-User-Type
        value: premium
    action:
      forwardTo:
      - serviceName: premium-service
        port: 80
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - name: X-User-Type
        value: free
    action:
      forwardTo:
      - serviceName: free-service
        port: 80
```

This example routes traffic based on the `X-User-Type` header.

### Example: Traffic Splitting

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: traffic-splitting
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /app
      filters:
        - type: RequestMirror
          requestMirror:
            backendRef:
              name: canary-service
              port: 8080
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: stable-service
            port: 8080
            weight: 80
          - serviceName: canary-service
            port: 8080
            weight: 20
```

This configuration splits traffic to `/app` with 80% directed to the stable version of the application and 20% to a canary version.

---

### Extensibility with Filters

The Gateway API's extensibility is achieved through filters. Filters can modify requests and responses, enabling functionalities like URL rewriting, header manipulation, and traffic splitting.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: rewrite-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "example.com"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /old-path
      filters:
        - type: URLRewrite
          urlRewrite:
            path:
              replaceFullPath: /new-path
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: my-service
            port: 80
```

This example rewrites `/old-path` to `/new-path` before forwarding the request.

---

### TLS Configuration

TLS configuration is handled within the `Listener` resource of a `Gateway`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
spec:
  listeners:
  - name: https-listener
    protocol: HTTPS
    port: 443
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
        - name: my-tls-secret
          kind: Secret
```

This configures TLS termination at the Gateway using the `my-tls-secret`.

---

### Example: Multi-Tenant Gateways

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: multi-tenant-gateway
spec:
  listeners:
  - name: tenant-a
    hostname: tenant-a.example.com
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - name: tenant-a-cert
  - name: tenant-b
    hostname: tenant-b.example.com
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - name: tenant-b-cert
```

This example demonstrates how multiple tenants can share a single Gateway, with separate hostnames and certificates.

---

## Deployment and Installation

1.  **Install CRDs:** The Gateway API requires installing CRDs. This can be done independently or as part of a Gateway controller installation.
2.  **Install a Gateway Controller:** Choose a suitable controller (e.g., Envoy Gateway, Contour, NGINX Gateway Fabric). Follow the controller's documentation


## Key Concepts

The Kubernetes Gateway API offers a modern approach to managing ingress traffic in your cluster. It surpasses the Ingress API in flexibility and power, allowing you to define intricate routing rules and leverage different gateway controllers.

### Core Components

* **GatewayClass:** Defines the behavior of a set of gateways. It establishes a one-to-one relationship with a gateway controller, which provisions infrastructure to handle ingress traffic. Multiple `GatewayClass` resources can coexist, catering to different environments or needs (e.g., production vs. development).
* **Gateway:** Represents how external traffic is translated to backend services. It references a `GatewayClass` and defines listeners (logical endpoints) for accepting traffic. Gateways enable advanced configurations, such as specifying allowed protocols and enabling mutual TLS authentication.
* **Listener:** Binds to an address and port, specifying the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, TCP) to accept incoming requests. Listeners can include multiple TLS certificates for scenarios like multi-domain hosting.
* **HTTPRoute:** Defines how HTTP traffic matching a specific profile should be routed to a backend service. It references a `Gateway` and its listener(s) and specifies routing rules based on hostnames, paths, and headers. Advanced features include traffic splitting and fault injection for testing resilience.
* **TCPRoute:** Facilitates routing for non-HTTP protocols at Layer 4, enabling support for custom TCP-based applications.
* **UDPRoute:** Routes Layer 4 UDP traffic for use cases like DNS or video streaming.
* **TLSRoute:** Provides explicit control over TLS traffic at Layer 4, complementing the flexibility of `TCPRoute`.

---

### Routing HTTP Traffic

1. **Define a GatewayClass:** Associate it with a specific gateway controller (e.g., Envoy Gateway) running in your cluster. Ensure the controller is installed and configured properly.
2. **Create a Gateway:** Specify listeners for incoming traffic. Use advanced listener configurations, such as specifying SNI (Server Name Indication) for multi-domain TLS support.
3. **Define HTTPRoutes:** Map incoming HTTP requests to backend services based on hostnames, paths, headers, or query parameters. Advanced use cases include routing traffic based on geolocation or user agents.

#### Example: Routing Based on Query Parameters

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: query-routing
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - queryParams:
            - name: version
              value: beta
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: beta-service
            port: 8080
    - matches:
        - queryParams:
            - name: version
              value: stable
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: stable-service
            port: 8080
```

This example routes requests based on the `version` query parameter.

---

### Associating a GatewayClass with a Gateway Controller

* Each `GatewayClass` references a specific gateway controller by name.
* The gateway controller manages the lifecycle of gateways belonging to its associated `GatewayClass`. For example, the `nginx` gateway controller provisions and manages gateways for an `NginxGatewayClass`.
* You can have multiple `GatewayClasses` and controllers to cater to different routing needs or leverage cloud-provider-specific controllers like AWS or GCP.

---

### Configuring a Gateway for Ingress

* Gateways define listeners to accept traffic based on port and protocol. Advanced configurations allow:
  * Associating multiple hostnames to a single listener for virtual hosting.
  * Implementing rate limiting at the gateway level.
* Gateways reference the `GatewayClass` that determines the responsible gateway controller, enabling features like automatic scaling and load balancing.

---

### Defining Routes to Application Services

* `HTTPRoutes` specify routing rules for HTTP traffic, supporting advanced features like retries, timeouts, and custom headers.
* They reference the gateway and its listener(s) that should handle the traffic.
* Routes can specify one or more hostnames to match incoming requests.
* Paths within the URL can be used for more granular routing within the route.
* Each route references the backend service (usually a `ClusterIP` service) that should receive the traffic. For redundancy, routes can distribute traffic among multiple backends using weighted rules.

#### Example: Fault Injection

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: fault-injection
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /test
      filters:
        - type: RequestHeaderModifier
          requestHeaderModifier:
            add:
              X-Debug-Mode: "true"
        - type: FaultInjection
          faultInjection:
            delay:
              fixedDelay: 5s
            abort:
              httpStatus: 503
      action:
        forwardTo:
          - serviceName: test-service
            port: 80
```

This example adds a 5-second delay and injects an HTTP 503 error for debugging.

### Demo: Consuming a Kubernetes Application Using the Gateway API

This demo showcases a basic scenario where the Envoy Gateway controller is used:

1. A simple application is deployed in the cluster.
2. A `GatewayClass` for the Envoy Gateway is defined.
3. A `Gateway` with an HTTP listener on port 80 is created.
4. An `HTTPRoute` references the gateway and its listener, and routes traffic to the application's service.
5. Accessing the external IP address associated with the gateway leads to the application.

#### Example: Gateway with Multi-Protocol Support

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: multi-protocol-gateway
spec:
  listeners:
  - name: http-listener
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
  - name: tcp-listener
    port: 3306
    protocol: TCP
  - name: tls-listener
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - name: my-tls-cert
```

This example demonstrates how a single gateway can handle HTTP, TCP, and HTTPS traffic.

### Migrating from the Ingress API to the Gateway API

* Existing Ingress definitions need to be converted to Gateway API resources.
* The `Ingress2gateway` tool can help automate this process for basic scenarios.
* Key differences between the APIs include:
    * Gateway API requires explicit listener definitions in gateways.
    * Processing is dictated by gateways referenced in `HTTPRoutes` (not `IngressClasses`).
    * Gateway API doesn't have a default backend service (explicit routing is required).

#### Additional Migration Considerations

* **TLS:** Ensure TLS configurations in `Ingress` are explicitly defined as `Listeners` in `Gateway`.
* **Annotations:** Replace controller-specific annotations with standardized fields in Gateway API resources.
* **Backend Configuration:** Explicitly define backend services and weights for advanced load balancing.

---

### Benefits of Gateway API

* **Flexibility:** Supports complex routing rules, multi-protocol traffic, and multiple gateway controllers.
* **Decoupling:** Separates route definitions from gateway controller implementation, enabling portability.
* **Extensibility:** Allows for future API enhancements, custom filters, and innovation in traffic management.
* **Security:** Explicit role-based separation of responsibilities and enhanced TLS support.
* **Observability:** Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for better traffic visibility.

---

### Additional Considerations

* **Security:** Gateways may require additional configuration for TLS termination, mutual authentication, and DDoS protection.
* **Monitoring:** Monitor gateway and controller logs for troubleshooting. Use metrics to analyze traffic patterns and detect anomalies.
* **Scalability:** Leverage Gateway controllers that support auto-scaling and high availability to handle varying traffic loads.
* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to organizational and regulatory requirements for traffic management and encryption.
